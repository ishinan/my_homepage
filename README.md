Color Semantics
Bootstrap's UI colors contain semantic information and shouldn't be changed arbitrarily. However we can tweak them to better fit the color palette.

SOFT PEACH
Light shades
Use this color as the background for your dark-on-light designs, or the text color of an inverted design.

VIKING
Light accent
Accent colors can be used to bring attention to design elements by contrasting with the rest of the palette.

WEDGEWOOD
Main brand color
This color should be eye-catching but not harsh. It can be liberally applied to your layout as its main identity.

FOREST GREEN
Dark accent
Another accent color to consider. Not all colors have to be used - sometimes a simple color scheme works best.

OUTER SPACE
Dark shades
Use as the text color for dark-on-light designs, or as the background for inverted designs.
